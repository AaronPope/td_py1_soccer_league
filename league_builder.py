    pass # just until I get rolling on this thing!

# Divide players into three teams
    # Sharks
    # Dragons
    # Raptors
# Teams should have the same number of players
    # and the experienced players should be divided equally across the three teams
# Create a text file names 'teams.txt' that includes:
    # the name of a team
    # the players on the team
# Sample output
    # Sharks
    # Frank Jones, YES, Jim and Jan Jones
    # Sarah Palmer, YES, Robin and Sari Washington
    # Joe Smith, NO, Bob and Jamie Smith

# EXTRA CREDIT (1/2)
    # Create 18 text files, to serve as welcome letters to the players' guardians
        # 1 file should be created for each player
        # Use the players name as the name of the file
            # lowercase
            # underscore between first and last name
            # E.g. - "jimmy_johns.txt

# EXTRA CREDIT (2/2)
    # Ensure that each file includes the following: 
        # Begin with "Dear [guardian(s) name(s)]"
        # player's name
        # team name
        # date & time of first practice
