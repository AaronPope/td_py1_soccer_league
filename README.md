# td_py1_soccer_league
For Treehouse TechDegree (Python), Unit 1: Build a Soccer League


## Requirements
1. Create a script named league_builder.py.
  * Make sure the script doesn't execute when imported; put all of your logic and function calls inside of an if __name__ == "__main__": block.
2. Create variables and programming logic to divide the 18 players into three teams: 
  * Sharks
  * Dragons
  * Raptors
3. Make sure the teams have the same number of players on them, 
  * and that the experienced players are divided equally across the three teams.
4. Create a text file named teams.txt that includes:
  * the name of a team
  * followed by the players on that team.
5. List all three teams and their players.
  * In the list of teams include: 
    * the team name on one line, followed by a separate line for each player. Include the player's name, whether the player has experience playing soccer, and the player's guardian names. Separate each bit of player information by a comma. For example, the text file might start something like this:

Sharks
Frank Jones, YES, Jim and Jan Jones
Sarah Palmer, YES, Robin and Sari Washington
Joe Smith, NO, Bob and Jamie Smith
